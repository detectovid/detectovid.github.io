        <h1>Mission</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Our vision is to develop a smartphone app that can be used by everyone in the world to find out in minutes whether they have COVID-19. We are utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to identify patterns undetectable by humans from the
        unique respiratory signatures of lungs damaged by the virus. From extensive research, we believe we can achieve 90% or more accuracy and help control this pandemic!
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope to create a near future with:
        <ol>
          <li>Billions of people at home confidently knowing they are not infected</li>
          <li>Reduced burden on health care systems, equipped with technology to know who to treat first</li>
          <li>Eliminated necessity of social distancing</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe low cost, early detection, which will allow society to pinpoint the locations of the virus, is the key to end the pandemic and necessity for lockdowns

        <h1>Why This Will Work</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        Because COVID-19 affects the throat and lungs of patients, even in early stages, detecting it in early stages from breathing and coughing sounds is feasible. Through analysis of this data, artificial intelligence is able to detect the signatures of COVID-19,
        even without knowing the inner workings of the actual microbial changes causing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is mentored by leading authorities in AI, signal processing, and clinical research from both industry and academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including CMU, MIT, and Cambridge. Our differentiator is that we have already started gathering authentic data from hospitals under approved clinic study. We are propelled
        by a swarm of self-motivated and passionate student AI engineers from various institutions. We are growing in number and are driven to serve humanity with no expectation of financial reward. </p>

        <h1>What You Can Expect</h1>
      </header>
      <p>
        We are working tirelessly to rapidly develop accurate AI algorithms and a smartphone app / website. We expect to have a prototype by July and a production-grade system by August. Our app will keep improving weekly and will provide predictions of COVID-19
        risk. We intend to deploy it globally, saving lives in developing countries, while also preparing the world to handle future pandemics and a potential re-appearance of COVID-19 in November.

      <p>
        We are a passionate team of AI engineers, mobile web app developers, and medical professionals. All of us are volunteers and most of us are students under 30. From our hearts, we want to do our best to help the situation and canâ€™t think of anything more
        noble. We are supported by faculty and professors at our universities as well as industry veterans Silicon Valley.
